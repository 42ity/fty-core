DB access, OS integration and image scripts, ...

This repository is currently(*) concerned with overall OS image integration
of an 42ITy based product, providing low-level bits not really relevant to
any particular application component codebase.

* It used to have more code in the beginning, but it was dispersed into other
repositories over time, to help manageability and reduce build/test scopes.
