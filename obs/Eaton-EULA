		Test NDA and a Beta Testing Agreement with Eaton. By using the Software,
		you, as End-User, agree on the terms and conditions of this Beta Test
		End-User License Agreement or Beta Test EULA. Your use of the Software

		In case you would not be one of Eaton's Beta Test Partners but would

		have accepted these terms and their limitations, and exclusions will
		apply. Eaton will however reserve its rights at law, contract or equity.
  2.2	The limitations of use of the Beta Testing Agreement shall apply except
		for and vis-a-vis Software Components, which are made available and
		licensed under an Open Source License (the "Open Source Software

		is governed by the Open Source License terms which are associated with
		these OSSC.
  2.3	Unless any portion of the Software would be specifically designated as
		an OSSC, Beta Test Partner should assume that such Software is
		proprietary and that its use is solely governed by these terms.
  2.4	Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein and the terms and
		conditions of the Beta Test NDA and the Beta Test Agreement, Eaton
		hereby grants Beta Test Partner a limited, personal, internal to Beta
		Test Partner only, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-assignable,
		royalty-free, fully-paid right and license to use the Software. This
		right and license does not include and it specifically excludes, the
		right to grant or authorize sublicenses, make any copy on any support
		or media, compile, modify, enhance and create Derivative Works of the
		Software. 
  2.5	In no event will Beta Test Partner or any End-User have the right to
		distribute, commercialize, or otherwise exploit the Software, or any

		will not provide copies, sublicense, represent outside its organization,
		publicly perform, display, demonstrate or disclose to third parties,
		lease, promote, market, supply, sale or offer for sale, commercially
		exploit or generally carry out any act with the Software, or any portion

		Partner IT Environment. 
  2.9	Affiliates of the Beta Test Partner and their employees are allowed to

		use or access the Software,  Beta Test Partner shall inform Eaton in
		advance. Beta Test Partner shall provide the name of the Agent(s) and
		details of intended use and any scope of work connected to the Software.
		Eaton will inform Beta Test Partner in writing whether such Agent(s)
		will be authorised to use and access the Software (the "Authorized
		Agents").
  2.11	Beta Test Partner shall be and shall remain liable for any misuse,
		illegal use or breach of this Agreement by any of its Affiliates and
		Agents.
  3.	Ownership
  3.1	Nothing herein will be construed as assigning, transferring or
		exclusively licensing any rights in the Software that Eaton or its
		Affiliates may have. Except for the limited license granted to Beta
		Test Partner  in this Agreement, Beta Test Partner or End-User will
		not assert any right, title, or interest in or to any of the Software
		or any proprietary rights or Intellectual Property therein. Eaton will
		also acquire, own, and retain all rights, title, and interest, including
		but not limited to Intellectual Property, in and to all Derivative Works
		of the Software.

		and details on the demonstration. Beta Test Partner will not show or
		demonstrate the Software unless it receives the express written consent
		from Eaton to do so. 
  4.4	Title to the Software shall be exclusively retained by Eaton (or any of
		its Affiliates) until and unless Eaton (or any of its Affiliates) and
		Beta Test Partner reach an agreement on the supply of the Software to
		Beta Test Partner under commercial terms. For the avoidance of doubt,
		neither Eaton nor any of its Affiliates will have an obligation to enter
		into such commercial transaction for such Software with Beta Test

		its Affiliates will have an obligation to acquire any commercial license
		of such Software.

		immediately at any time effective upon written notice under the
		following conditions:
  7.1.1	by either Party if the other Party and/or any of its Affiliates or

  7.1.3	by Eaton if there is a change or transfer in Control of the Beta Test
		Partner (or any change of ownership involving a known competitor of

		provided immediately to Eaton if there is a change in the Control in the
		Beta Test Partner; or
  7.1.4	by either Party for termination of the Beta Testing Agreement.
  7.2	Section 2 of this Agreement (Limited Release and Limitations of Use)

  8.	Warranty
  8.1	Eaton informs the Beta Test Partner and End-User that the Software is a
		pre-production unit that has  not yet been certified (such as CE
		certified). However, Eaton will ensure that such Software has undergone
		similar internal testing.  Eaton warrants that to the best of its
		knowledge, the Software is suitable for installation and use in the

		Partner or the End-User that the Software shall be free from defects in
		design, material, and workmanship, under normal use. 
  8.2	Eaton shall not be liable for damage due to third party acts,
		atmospheric discharges, excess voltage, chemical influences and for loss

		remedy under the Warranty shall be, at Eaton's option and discretion, to
		either repair, replace or remove at no additional charge, the defective
		Software (or the defective part of the Software) thereof, which is
		proved to breach such Warranty under the Agreement. 
  8.4	Except for the express Warranty set forth above in Section 8.1, Eaton
		makes no other representations or warranties, express or implied,
		statutory or otherwise, regarding the Software, their fitness for any
		particular purpose, their merchantability, fitness, quality, non
		infringement, or otherwise. 
  8.5	All drawings, descriptive matter, specifications and advertising issued
		by Eaton and any descriptions or illustrations contained in Eaton's
		catalogues or brochures are issued or published for the sole purpose of
		giving an approximate idea of the Software described in them.
  9.	Liability
  9.1	In no event, whether under contract, statutory law or tort, shall the
		aggregate liability of Eaton or any of its Affiliates, during the term
		of the Agreement, exceed the value of the Software in respect of which
		such liability arises, to the extent possible under mandatory applicable
		law.  This limit of liability is cumulative and not per-incident (i.e.,
		the existence of two or more claims will not enlarge this limit).
		Furthermore, it applies cumulatively to all of Eaton's Affiliates.
  9.2	In no event, whether under contract, statutory law or tort, Eaton or its
		Affiliates, officers, directors, employees, Agents, shall be liable for
		indirect, incidental or consequential damages, including but not limited
		to loss of profit, loss of use, loss of production or penalty payments

		international Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR) and any embargos or
		boycotts. The Beta Test Partner or End-User shall not (and it shall take

		jeopardy of breaching or violating any such laws, regulations,
		provisions and/or acts or any interpretations thereof.
  10.2	The Beta Test Partner or End-user and its Affiliates shall not - without

		provisions of this Agreement. The Parties shall then use all reasonable

		and enforceable substitute provision the effect of which is as close as
		possible to the intended effect of the invalid or unenforceable
		provision.
  17.5	Subject to the terms of the Beta Test NDA and the Beta Testing
		Agreement, this Agreement constitutes the entire agreement, and
		supersedes any previous agreements between the Parties relating to the
		subject matter of this Agreement, including but not limited to all
		previous communications, oral or written between the Parties. No terms
		contained in a Party's proposals, quotations, acknowledgements, invoices
		or other documentation shall be part of this Agreement or shall be
		binding on the other Party unless explicitly agreed in writing by the
		Parties.
  17.6	Each Party acknowledges that it has not relied on or been induced to
		enter into this Agreement by a representation, warranty, collateral
		agreement or other assurance other than those expressly set out in this
		Agreement or any document referred to in this Agreement. Each Party
		waives all rights and remedies (including any implied by law in any
		jurisdiction) that, but for this clause, might otherwise be available to
		it. 
  17.7	Nothing in this Agreement limits any liability of a Party arising as a
		result of fraud.
  17.8	This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of
		which shall be deemed an original, all of which shall constitute one and
		the same agreement. 
  18.	Governing Law
  18.1	This Agreement and any contractual or non-contractual obligations
		arising out of or in connection with it are governed by and shall be
		construed in accordance with the laws of England and Wales.
