#  \brief   Helper script for networking part of REST API /admin/systemctl
#  \author  Michal Vyskocil <MichalVyskocil@Eaton.com>
#  \details Helper script for networking part of REST API /admin/systemctl
#           Really calling networking services synchronously is not possible
#           as changes in network config tends to close connection, therefore
#           the REST API call would never reply to caller.
#           This script is called by systemd via "bios-networking.service",
#           thus not running in webserver context, which can report success
#           using the old HTTP(S) connection.

# to ensure REST API call at least replies before actually changing the network
