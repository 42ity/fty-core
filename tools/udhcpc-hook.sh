#  \brief   NTP synchronization and hostname setup for udhcpc
#  \author  Jim Klimov <EvgenyKlimov@Eaton.com>
#  \details Based on /etc/dhcp/dhclient-exit-hooks.d/ntp from Debian8 ntp
#           package, adapted for the 42ity project.
#           Included from (patched) /etc/udhcpc/default.script for 42ity project

NTP_DHCP_CONF=/var/lib/ntp/ntp.conf.dhcp

# The systemd service unit can be "disabled" or "masked" if users want a
# manually set clock - do not ask the DHCP client to request and perhaps
# override that manual setting in this case. Exit code for both is 1.
# Note that this flag only controls whether we change the service state;
# even if the unit is disabled, we can change its configuration file based
# on data received (or not) from DHCP.
# TODO: Differentiate somehow if the user also wanted a specific NTP
# server vs. one received from DHCP?
