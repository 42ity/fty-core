#  \brief   Helper script for REST API /admin/passwd
#  \author  Michal Vyskocil <MichalVyskocil@Eaton.com>
#  \details Helper script for REST API /admin/passwd
#           it does expect all the information on stdin to not accidentally leak it
#           /usr/bin/printf "%s\n%s\n%s\n" "user" "old_password" "new_password"
#           The new password strength is verified by "testpass.sh" helper script.
#  \todo    it acually DO NOT check the old password, because unix2_chkpwd has been
#           designed by very paranoid ppl and I am lazy to write own binary, so the check
#           is going to be on REST API level. But in order to maintain stable protocol, script
#           requires it.
