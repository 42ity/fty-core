# \file logrotate-rsyslog
# \brief Rotate the persistent log, keep 4 compressed backups maximum
# \author Michal Vyskocil <MichalVyskocil@eaton.com>
# \author Jim Klimov <EvgenyKlimov@Eaton.com>
# \details simple log rorating script, executed by rsyslog via outchannel directive
#          see /etc/rsyslog.d/00-ipc.conf
#          Note: This script should be atomically fast (rsyslog blocks until
#          the log-rotation handler returns). Anything expensive, such as
#          compression of the old log files, should be done separately (via
#          timer unit in this case); also this ensures the file is closed
#          and not written to by the logger before we start to compress it.

# Tickle the service to start compressing immediately (but asynchronously),
# if an instance of it is not yet running already
