#  \brief   Helper script for networking part of REST API /admin/systemctl
#  \author  Michal Vyskocil <MichalVyskocil@Eaton.com>
#  \details Helper script for networking part of REST API /admin/systemctl
#           calling networking services synchronously is not possible as
#           changes in network config tends to close connection, therefor the
#           REST API call never reply to caller. This script is called by systemd,
#           thus not running in webserver context, which can reply success using
#           old connection.

# to ensure REST API call at least reply before actually changing the network
