#  \brief   This script overrides "udhcpc"
#  \author  Jim Klimov <EvgenyKlimov@Eaton.com>
#  \details This script overrides "udhcpc" as called by "ifup" and friends
#           which have the command line hardcoded (and to bad defaults).
#           Should be installed into "/usr/local/sbin/udhcpc" to take effect.

# Inspect the caller and do the evil magic below only if it is "ifup" et al.
# If none of the suspects are found in call stack, fulfill original request
