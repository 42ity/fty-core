Usage: fty-route [list|add|del] ... routing details

        Manipulates routing table of network interfaces. It writes to
        /etc/network/interfaces, so all changes are persistent.

        list - print kernel routing table

        add - add new route, by default to the first network device.
        Last parameter can specify network device to use.

        del - delete matching line from interfaces file
        Last parameter can specify network device to use.

EXAMPLES:
        Add new route for first network device

        fty-route add -net 10.41.0.0/16 gw 192.168.0.1

        Add new route for specific device
        fty-route add -net 10.41.0.0/16 gw 192.168.0.1 (dev)? LAN3

        Remove route
        fty-route del -net 10.41.0.0/16 gw 192.168.0.1

        Remove route for specific device
        fty-route del -net 10.41.0.0/16 gw 192.168.0.1 LAN3
