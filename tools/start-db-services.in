SYSTEMCTL=@libexecdir@/@PACKAGE@/systemctl
#SYSTEMCTL=/usr/libexec/fty/systemctl
#SYSTEMCTL=/usr/libexec/bios/systemctl
#SYSTEMCTL=/bin/systemctl

### Note: starting the systemctl wrapper on ARM has noticeable overhead, so we
### clump several targets to act upon, rather than do a "clean" one-by-one run.
### This value can be set by envvar files pulled by the service, e.g. the clean
### mode is useful to debug problems, and has negligible overhead on X86.
### Final default for unknown systems is to not coalease (so to run one by one).
### Note that separately we process the SYSTEMCTL_COALESCE_INITIAL for the root
### dependency services that sometimes lock up while running systemctl (on ARM
### at least), maybe due to systemd changing state of those services at the
### same time?..
