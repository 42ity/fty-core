Poc of simple "poor man's" BIOS architecture
============================================

 * clients conected directly together
 * each one has DEALER for PUBLISHING
 * and one ROUTER socket for getting commands
 * built on top of czmq
 * uses zproto for network discovery messages
 * uses real netmon network linux stack
 * keeps the netmon_mock for testing purposes (--test-mode)

3 threads

 1. persistence: binds to the ROUTER socket and blindly prints everything to stdout
 2. netmon: connects using DEALER socket to persistence and netlogic and pushing data there
 3. netlogic: binds to the ROUTER socket for incomming events from netmon, connects to the persistence to forward messages there


How to build
~~~~~~~~~~~~
just type make (and be sure you've latest git snapshot from https://github.com/zeromq/czmq, does not work with a latest release!)

in a case you've installed it in a non-standard location, just modify Makefile
CPPFLAGS = -I /path/with/include
LDFLAGS = -L /path/with/shared/library -lczmq

and run with LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/with/shared/library

How to use
~~~~~~~~~~

c (client) no longer exists; previous start/stop/... commands not available

Note: during async nature of ROUTER/DEALER the communication between s and c (recv) is not done properly, however this is an on-time hack.
