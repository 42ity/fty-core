Poc of simple "poor man's" BIOS architecture
============================================

 * clients conected directly together
 * each one has DEALER for PUBLISHING
 * and one ROUTER socket for getting commands
 * built on top of czmq
 * uses zproto for network discovery messages
 * uses real netmon network linux stack
 * keeps the netmon_mock for testing purposes (--test-mode)

3 actors:

 1. persistence: binds to the ROUTER socket and blindly prints everything to stdout
 2. netmon mock: when  in --test-mode
 3. nut: connects to local NUT server

KNOWN ISSUES:
 netmon process is not being terminated; you need to terminate it manually
