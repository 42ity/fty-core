# Description: This OPTIONAL file is a configuration module
# for "sudo" and it contains definition of some command lines
# needed for (CI-driven or manual) testing of the $BIOS project.
# It relies on values set in the sudoers.d/bios_00_base file.
# See also the script to generate these needed $BIOS accounts:
#    tools/init-os-accounts.sh

# Shorthands to reference the specific commands or command-line (shell

### Manage the SASL daemon (needed for CI tests):
Cmnd_Alias SASLD	= /etc/init.d/saslauthd,/bin/systemctl start saslauthd,/bin/systemctl restart saslauthd,/bin/systemctl stop saslauthd

# Overall, what is currently allowed with different privileges?
Cmnd_Alias BIOS_TEST_PROGS	= SASLD
