# Description: This file is a configuration module for "sudo"
# and it contains definition of some command lines, list of
# usernames and/or %groupnames allowed to elevate privileges,
# and a list of usernames with whose credentials we can run as,
# which is overall needed for the $BIOS project. This config
# was verified for Debian 8 "testing", but should be generally
# portable among different moderately recent "sudo" releases.
# To use, just copy this file into /etc/sudoers.d/ (note that
# the filename should NOT contain "." dots) or append contents
# to /etc/sudoers on older OSes, and maybe adapt if required.
# See also the script to generate these needed $BIOS accounts:
#    tools/init-os-accounts.sh
