# Description: This file is a configuration module for "sudo"
# and it contains definition of some command lines, list of
# usernames and/or %groupnames allowed to elevate privileges,
# and a list of usernames with whose credentials we can run as,
# which is overall needed for the $BIOS project. This config
# was verified for Debian 8 "testing", but should be generally
# portable among different moderately recent "sudo" releases.
# To use, just copy this file into /etc/sudoers.d/ (note that
# the filename should NOT contain "." dots) or append contents
# to /etc/sudoers on older OSes, and maybe adapt if required.
# See also the script to generate these needed $BIOS accounts:
#    tools/init-os-accounts.sh

### Change date on this device:
Cmnd_Alias DATE	            = /usr/bin/date,/bin/date
### TODO: Remove hardcoded path both here and in the sources
Cmnd_Alias AUGTOOL          = /usr/bin/augtool -S -I/usr/share/bios/lenses -e
Cmnd_Alias BIOS_PASSWD      = @libexecdir@/@PACKAGE@/bios-passwd
Cmnd_Alias BIOS_NUTCONFIG   = @libexecdir@/@PACKAGE@/bios-nutconfig
Cmnd_Alias BIOS_SYSTEMCTL   = @libexecdir@/@PACKAGE@/systemctl

# Overall, what is currently allowed with different privileges?
Cmnd_Alias BIOS_PROGS	= DATE,AUGTOOL,BIOS_PASSWD,BIOS_SYSTEMCTL,BIOS_NUTCONFIG

# Who is allowed to elevate?
User_Alias BIOS_USERS	= %bios-admin,www-data,%bios-infra
# With whose privileges can this be executed?
Runas_Alias BIOS_RUNAS	= root

BIOS_USERS ALL=(BIOS_RUNAS) NOPASSWD:BIOS_PROGS
