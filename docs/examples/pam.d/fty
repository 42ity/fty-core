# Description:
# The PAM 'bios' service configuration file for the Eaton 42ity project.
# Note that this file must be named 'bios' to identify the service name.
# This allows members of the groups listed in /etc/security/fty_groups.conf
# (i.e. the 'bios' group by default) to PAM/SASL-authenticate to the daemons.
# See also the script to generate these needed 42ity accounts and groups:
#    tools/init-os-accounts.sh
#
# Most of the PAM setup code below is relatively standard boilerplate,
# it is here just to ensure these lines are defined regardless of
# the distribution used. Probably some of the explicit lines repeat
# definitions in "common-*" includables, but PAM does not complain
# and so we don't ;) If your older PAM does not support "include",
# just comment those lines away.
# The one actually unique snippet begins at "pam_listfile.so".
