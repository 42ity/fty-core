TODO
====

The list of known issues, which have to be addressed!

src/persist/assettopology.cc (MARIA_DB_CRASH):
-------------------------------------------------------------
-> The known issue with mariadb crash. Rework when crash would be fixed.

src/persist/assetmsg.cc (insert links):
-------------------------------------------------------------
-> Inserting of the information is not done yet. But it is assumed, that 
   It is not possible to insert the link (NULL,7,NULL,8) twice
   (src_out:src-id:dest_in:dest_id).

src/utils/messages :
--------------------
GCL: Major comments are same as previous on PR BIOS-347 :
-> The validation JSON file name should include the kind of message 
   (Request, Reply, Pub, Sub...),
-> The validation JSON file name should include the client name,
-> The validation schema should not have client module attribute
   name hardcoded,
-> The validation schema should have a version property,
-> the printf calls should be remplaced by a right log API usage.

see http://stash.mbt.lab.etn.com/projects/BIOS/repos/core/pull-requests/23
for more detail.

src/cli/cli-network.cc :
------------------------
 * Command line output does not match the documented definition at
   http://kamino.mbt.lab.etn.com:8200/display/BiosWiki/rfc-10
 * cli should use cidr to perform check on input values

BIOS-354 :
----------
-> In database is already stored an UTC_TIMESTAMP.
-> In monitorpersistence.cc a date is extracted as UNIX_TIME (with the 
   database function). Problem would appear with dates after 2038.
   Solution: 1. wait until in database would be implemented a 64-bit version
   of this function. 2. In case of need write our own PL/SQL function.

Upcoming CLEANUP-UP cycle :
------------------------

==== src/drivers/nut/nut-driver.h  ====
-> bad header guard
-> namespace

==== src/drivers/nut/nut-driver.cc  ====
-> namespace

==== src/drivers/nut/nut-actor.h  ====
-> namespace; header guard

==== src/drivers/nut/nut-actor.cc  ====
-> namespace

==== src/cored ====
I propose to drop this directory with its contents entirely

==== src/cli ====
I propose not to drop this directory yet; it's been removed from build

==== src/utils/<everything persistence related>  ====
-> move to src/persistence
-> namespace; suggestion: db
-> QUESTION: Do we want to rename some of the files with the move?
  (i.e. assetmsgpersistence.cc -> assetmsg.cc or similar)

==== src/utils/{cidr.*, log.*} ====
-> implied namespace change

==== src/utils/zmq.hpp ====
I suggest to remove this file

==== src/utils/messages  ====
I propose to drop content of this directory; not the directory itself
-> after the rename move zproto files to src/shared/messages;
-> generated .c & .h files will go into src/include

==== src/web ====
Because I haven't seen the contents of (or worked with) this directory before,
I wouldn't like to suggest any clean-up tasks here. Perhaps MHR could weigh in
if anything is needed to be done here.

==== tools/ ====
-> drop SqlLite.sql
-> drop my1db.db
-> rename db.sql to skeleton.sql (import.sql... anything); perhaps even 
-> we need to come up with a solution to dbinit.h; dbpath and dbpath.h.in files

==== tests/* ====
-> rename utils to shared, to reflect the change
-> do not drop the cli

==== src/include/defs.h ====
-> should become a file with only declarations; move all definitions to some
   .c file and link consumers with that, so there are no conflicts if several
   objects in one program #include this defs.h

=== The building infrastructure ===

==== Makefile.am =====
-> Generate a docs/devel/index.html with the list of generated HTML and
   unprocessed text files and a link into "doxygen/" and deliver it;
   add a footer with the build information (git, host, timestamps...)
   This may be based on the recently added .git_details file contents.
-> research and refactor generation of doxygen/ docs, preferably to have
   them really generated (5+ Mbytes worth) in the build directory but
   with relative URL-links to src/* rather than build-host absolute paths

==== configure and .in processed files ====
-> (?) refactor some scripts to become generated with substitution of default
   passwords, user/group names, etc. instead of current hardcoding.
-> SASL MUX path - test the sasl service startup/config files for the mux
   path or directory that contains it (at least the few predefined variants)
   as a further fallback option
-> Thread Sanitizer builds currently do not work; possibly some compiler
   flags are in conflict. Research and fix.

==== CI and RC scripts ====
-> there is a lot of duplicated logic regarding startup of components and
   needed system services (malamute, tntnet, mysql) across different scripts
   for CI and end-user runtime environments. Converge these so only one is
   actually developed (e.g. `tools/rc-bios`) and others call it.
-> experiment: verify whether our component programs need to start with an
   `LD_PRELOAD` when built with ASan support, like is currently done for the
   `bios_web.so` as part of `tntnet` during `make web-test` to support the
   third-party libraries with dynamic runtime instrumentation. If so, improve
   the `tools/rc-bios` script to detect (`ldd`?) and meet this need when
   running our project's programs.
