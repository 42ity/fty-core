src/utils/messages :
--------------------
GCL: Major comments are same as previous on PR BIOS-347 :
-> The validation JSON file name should include the kind of message 
   (Request, Reply, Pub, Sub...),
-> The validation JSON file name should include the client name,
-> The validation schema should not have client module attribute
   name hardcoded,
-> The validation schema should have a version property,
-> the printf calls should be remplaced by a right log API usage.

see http://stash.mbt.lab.etn.com/projects/BIOS/repos/core/pull-requests/23
for more detail.

src/cli/cli-network.cc :
------------------------
 * Command line output does not match the documented definition at
   http://kamino.mbt.lab.etn.com:8200/display/BiosWiki/rfc-10
 * cli should use cidr to perform check on input values

BIOS-354 :
----------
-> It is hardly possible to use SQLite for testing purposes, because its
   database often becomes busy and tests are failed. It is caused by the
   simplicity of SQLite (it can't properly work with connection-pool and
   concurrent threads). So we need to test on MariaDb.
-> In database is already stored an UTC_TIMESPAMP.
-> In monitorpersistence.cc a date is extracted as UNIX_TIME (with the 
   database function). Problem would appear with dates after 2038.
   Solution: 1. wait until in database would be implemented a 64-bit version
   of this function. 2. In case of need write our own PL/SQL function.
