src/cli/cli-network.cc
---------------------
 * Command line output does not match http://kamino.mbt.lab.etn.com:8200/display/BiosWiki/rfc-10
 * cli should use cidr to perform check on input values

BIOS-354:
-> Write all unit tests.
-> Write documentation (3 classes are not documented properly)
-> It is hardly posible to use SQLite for testing purposes, because it database often become busy and tests are failed. It caused the simplisity of SQLite (it can'r properly work with connection-pool and concurrent threads).
   So need to test on MariaDb.
