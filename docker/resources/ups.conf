# Network UPS Tools: example ups.conf
#
# --- SECURITY NOTE ---
#
# If you use snmp-ups and set a community string in here, you 
# will have to secure this file to keep other users from obtaining
# that string.  It needs to be readable by upsdrvctl and any drivers,
# and by upsd.
#
# ---
#
# This is where you configure all the UPSes that this system will be
# monitoring directly.  These are usually attached to serial ports, but
# USB devices and SNMP devices are also supported.
#
# This file is used by upsdrvctl to start and stop your driver(s), and
# is also used by upsd to determine which drivers to monitor.  The 
# drivers themselves also read this file for configuration directives.
#
# The general form is:
# 
# [upsname]
#       driver = <drivername>
#         port = <portname>
#	< any other directives here >
#
# The section header ([upsname]) can be just about anything as long as
# it is a single word inside brackets.  upsd uses this to uniquely 
# identify a UPS on this system.
#
# If you have a UPS called snoopy, your section header would be "[snoopy]".
# On a system called "doghouse", the line in your upsmon.conf to monitor
# it would look something like this:
#
# 	MONITOR snoopy@doghouse 1 upsmonuser mypassword master
#
# It might look like this if monitoring in slave mode:
#
# 	MONITOR snoopy@doghouse 1 upsmonuser mypassword slave
#
# Configuration directives
# ------------------------
#
# These directives are used by upsdrvctl only and should be specified outside
# of a driver definition:
#
#    maxretry: Optional.  Specify the number of attempts to start the driver(s),
#              in case of failure, before giving up. A delay of 'retrydelay' is
#              inserted between each attempt. Caution should be taken when using
#              this option, since it can impact the time taken by your system to
#              start.
#
#              The default is 1 attempt.
#
#  retrydelay: Optional.  Specify the delay between each restart attempt of the
#              driver(s), as specified by 'maxretry'. Caution should be taken
#              when using this option, since it can impact the time taken by your
#              system to start.
#
#              The default is 5 seconds.
# 
# These directives are common to all drivers that support ups.conf:
#
#  driver: REQUIRED.  Specify the program to run to talk to this UPS.  
#          apcsmart, bestups, and sec are some examples.
#
#    port: REQUIRED.  The serial port where your UPS is connected.  
#          /dev/ttyS0 is usually the first port on Linux boxes, for example.
#
# sdorder: optional.  When you have multiple UPSes on your system, you
#          usually need to turn them off in a certain order.  upsdrvctl
#          shuts down all the 0s, then the 1s, 2s, and so on.  To exclude
#          a UPS from the shutdown sequence, set this to -1.
#
#          The default value for this parameter is 0.
#
#  nolock: optional, and not recommended for use in this file.
#
#          If you put nolock in here, the driver will not lock the
#          serial port every time it starts.  This may allow other 
#          processes to seize the port if you start more than one by 
#          mistake.
#
#          This is only intended to be used on systems where locking
#          absolutely must be disabled for the software to work.
#
# maxstartdelay: optional.  This can be set as a global variable
#                above your first UPS definition and it can also be
#                set in a UPS section.  This value controls how long
#                upsdrvctl will wait for the driver to finish starting.
#                This keeps your system from getting stuck due to a
#                broken driver or UPS.
#
#                The default is 45 seconds.
#
#
# Anything else is passed through to the hardware-specific part of
# the driver.
# 
# Examples
# --------
#
# A simple example for a UPS called "powerpal" that uses the blazer_ser
# driver on /dev/ttyS0 is:
#
# [powerpal]
#	driver = blazer_ser
#	port = /dev/ttyS0
#	desc = "Web server"
#
# If your UPS driver requires additional settings, you can specify them
# here.  For example, if it supports a setting of "1234" for the
# variable "cable", it would look like this:
# 
[ups]
 	driver =  dummy-ups
	port =  ups.dev
	desc = "dummy"
[UPS1-LAB]
 	driver =  dummy-ups
	port =  UPS1-LAB.dev
	desc = "9PX-31-xml"
[ePDU1-LAB]
 	driver =  dummy-ups
	port = ePDU1-LAB.dev 
	desc = "epdu-marlin-ma-snmp"
#
# To find out if your driver supports any extra settings, start it with
# the -h option and/or read the driver's documentation.

# Set maxretry to 3 by default, this should mitigate race with slow devices:
#maxretry = 3
