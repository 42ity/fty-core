# and so breaks our explicit dependency ordering
#PrivateTmp = yes

# Normally this service should start very quickly; however on congested
# hypervisors with slower I/O it tends to be killed by systemd after 90s
# and then by design blocks the rest of product startup as the system is
# not in a known usable state.
# Try to avoid this situation by allowing a (still finite) larger timeout.
