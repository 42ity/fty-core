[Unit]
Description=Milestone for all 42ity-related services that should start after license is accepted
# Note: Assert* may become available in a later version of systemd than what
# we have in Debian 8; but for now we have to do the ExecStart* tricks below.
# And note that Condition is too weak for this - it has the service "active"
# though with a failed condition, and for dependencies like "fty-db-engine"
# this status sometimes suffices to start up.
#AssertFileNotEmpty=@ftydatadir@/fty-eula/license
#ConditionFileNotEmpty=@ftydatadir@/fty-eula/license
#ConditionPathExists=@ftydatadir@/fty-eula/license

# This unit per se does not require bios-pre-eula.target to function, only
# the EULA acceptance file that is created by someone (tntnet, ssh, ...)

[Service]
Type=oneshot
### the service shall be considered active even when all its processes exited
RemainAfterExit=yes
### if starting failed, do not loop, wait for path (or start-db-services script)
Restart=no
###FALLBACK: If .path is not working, should we restart OCCASIONALLY until successful?
###Restart=on-failure
###RestartSec=30m
User=root
ExecStartPre=/bin/dash -c "sleep 2 ; /usr/bin/test -s @ftydatadir@/fty-eula/license"
ExecStart=/bin/dash -c "while ! /usr/bin/test -s @ftydatadir@/fty-eula/license ; do sleep 3 ; done"
ExecStartPost=-/bin/systemctl start --no-block fty-license-accepted.target

### Starting bios.service should unmask, enable and start all co-bundled units
### blocked by not-yet-accpeted EULA
ExecStartPost=-/bin/systemctl start --no-block bios.service
ExecStartPost=-/bin/systemctl start --no-block bios-target-watchdog.timer

### Tell existing bus clients, like tntnet@bios, that we are good to go
ExecStartPost=/bin/dash -c "/usr/bin/bmsg publish eula ACCEPTED"

### Forbid to break in for sensitive data after deployment becomes used
ExecStartPost=/bin/dash -c "@libexecdir@/@PACKAGE@/disable-root-account"
