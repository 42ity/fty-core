[Unit]
Description=Milestone for all 42ity-related services that should start after license is accepted
# Note: Assert* may become available in a later version of systemd than what
# we have in Debian 8; but for now we have to do the ExecStart* tricks below.
# And note that Condition is too weak for this - it has the service "active"
# though with a failed condition, and for dependencies like "fty-db-engine"
# this status sometimes suffices to start up.
#AssertFileNotEmpty=@ftydatadir@/fty-eula/license
#ConditionFileNotEmpty=@ftydatadir@/fty-eula/license
# This unit per se does not require bios-pre-eula.target to function
