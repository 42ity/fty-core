[Install]
# Note: this service is both WantedBy (triggered to start with no waiting
# to complete) and Requires/After the multi-user.target. So when system
# finishes proper basic startup, it triggers/schedules a startup of the
# bios.service (and that triggers bios.target) which actually takes place
# after the multi-user.target has reported completion of its own startup.
WantedBy=multi-user.target
